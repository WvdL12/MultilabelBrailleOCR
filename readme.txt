# Zenodo MultilabelBrailleOCR dataset publication

This readme references the supplementary dataset, published on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17453802

This publication contains the processed Braille character image data as well as model evaluation results used in A Robust Dot-focused Classification Approach to Convolutional Braille Recognition, approved for publishing by the Journal of Universal Computer Science (J.UCS). The study was conducted as part of a BSc Computer Science masters thesis on Optical character recognition of Braille text, at Stellenbosch University (SU).
The data used was sourced from two publicly available data repositories:

The Angelina Set, by Ovodov, I.G.
The DSBI Dataset, by Li, R., Liu, H., Wang, X. and Qian, Y.


The following files are included.

* angelina_documents_splits.tsv details the assigned subset (train / validate / test) of each document in the Angelina Braille dataset.
* angelina.rar contains the extracted, standardised Braille character datasets with target labels, corresponding to all characters extracted from the documents in the Angelina train / validate / test subsets.
* dsbi.rar contains the extracted, standardised Braille character datasets with target labels, corresponding to all characters extracted from the documents in the full DSBI dataset.
* Model Performances and Experiments - JUCS Article includes the primary evaluations utilised in the Journal article.
* Expanded Model Performances and Experiments - Stellenbosch MSc Thesis includes further evaluations with additional metrics and experiments, utilised in the Masters thesis submitted at Stellenbosch University.
* This readme.txt file contains a brief description of the dataset.
